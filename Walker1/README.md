# Walker1

![Walker1 render](walker_render_lhq.png)

Walker1 is my first lego technic walking robot. I consider it reasonably robust, in the sense that if anyone where to build it from the instructions and turn it on, it would likely actually walk.

The instructions can be found [here](Walker1.pdf).
